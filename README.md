# Resource Monitor Project (Python)

The application features a graphical interface with four buttons, allowing you to select one of the following charts: CPU, RAM, DISK, and an Exit button.

Pressing the CPU button opens a real-time graph displaying the current percentage usage of the processor. At the top of the graph, the real-time percentage value is shown.
For RAM, a graph will open, showing the percentage of RAM being used.
For Disk, the chart displays the total disk space, the used space, and the free space.
